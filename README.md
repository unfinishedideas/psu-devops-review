## Peter Wells, CS-510: SysAdmin and DevOps

## About

This is a repo for CS-510 Systems Administration and DevOps in Fall 2023 at Portland State University. I am uploading this as a record of the work I did to setup the class VM's: a freeBSD firewall / router and homelab ubuntu machine with many services running on it. The homeworks and final document my process (and struggles) with setting these up as well as the final configurations. See the `/final` folder for the most up to date ubtuntu Docker-Compose file. Thanks for stopping by!
