# NOTE THIS HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH ../hw4/docker-compose.yml

# Peter Wells, 11/13/2023, CS-510 System Administration and DevOps

# This docker compose file will set up both a samba server to /mnt/samba_share and a pi-hole dns server
# For pihole, be sure change the environment variables to ones that match your set up better and
# change your dns server to 127.1.2.3 (or whatever you set FTLCONF_LOCAL_IPV4 to)

# For samba, create the directory /mnt/samba_share and chmod -R 777 /mnt before running.
# I suggest changing the username from admin and password 12345 (in the command section)

# They are based on these examples:
# Samba: https://github.com/dperson/samba/blob/master/docker-compose.yml
# PiHole: https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole
